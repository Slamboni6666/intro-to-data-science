# Project Ideas to Select from or to Inspire your Own

Listed below are a number of potential projects you and your group may select from to 


### Web Scraping Crypto Currency Prices to Explore what Makes certain Coins Appealing

Recommended for:
 - Students interested in acquiring and analyzing financial data
 - Students looking to scrape their own dataset
 - Students interested in Natural Language Processing

Cryptocurrencies have recently been growing in popularity given the metoeric rise and fall of certain coins over the last few years. With an increasingly digitized future, cryptocurrency may eventually become an effective means of payment.

For this project, we require a website that hosts all the relevant information for cryptocurrencies such as  NFTs, their last seven daysâ€™ trend, etc. One sure website is [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/). Over a period of time,  say one month, all data should be scraped from this website and tabulated. Other information related to each cryptocurrency should be acquired from auxillary websites (text-based information related to each coin that can be mined and/or compared). Based on coin-specific financial performance data as well as text-related to each coin, can we determine which coins are most/least similar to one another? Can we cluster coins based on these pairwise rankings?

Analytical Methods to consider using:
 - TF-IDF for word frequency based on each coin.
 - Word Mover's Distance (WMD) to determine which coins most resemble each other based on systematically obtained text describing each coin.

### The Modal Patient - Identifying the Characteristics of the Most Common Patient in a Hospital

Recommended for:
 - Students interested in analyzing an existing (and real-world) clinical dataset
 - Students who prefer manipulating an existing dataset (PostgreSQL expertise required) and with an established code community
 - 



The MIMIC-IV dataset is a recently released update of the MIMIC-III dataset of patient admission and care at the Beth Deconess
