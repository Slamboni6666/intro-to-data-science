This sub-repository contains all of the project related files for the Winter 2022 offering of the Carleton University Intro. to Data Science course.

The sub-directories contain project ideas and various materials in support of student projects. The goal of the course is to expose students to experiential projects that contribute to the borader knowledge-base. For projects that are more research-oriented, this means producing a course-long project that might address previously unanswered questions. 

The goal of the course is for student projects to contribute in some way to advancing human collective knowledge. Certain projects, in pursuing a particularly interesting and yet-unanswered research question, will likely be provided the support to see their work refined and submitted to a potential scientific venue for publication. Other projects may be proposed for submission to a scientific pre-print archive. The purpose of this course if to provide students with the experientail learning opportunity to succeed in generating new knowledge and recieving some atrtribution for those efforts.

More inforation on this process is to come later in the semester. Stay tuned!
